## ü§î Overview

- The repo contains [Python 3](https://python.org) script, which uses russian proxies and do load testing of web resources using API.
- ‚ö† The script uses a proxy, but be careful, it is desirable to use a VPN.

## üöÄ Quick start

### Windows

- Install [Python 3.8](https://python.org) (or later version)
  > ‚ö† **IMPORTANT**: Make sure to select `Add Python to PATH` checkbox ([see screenshot](http://wind10.ru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pp_image_4620_v0cz5agbht0001_add_Python_to_Path.png))

- Clone repository:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Luzhnuy/attacker.git
  ```

- Run `install.bat` to install all the required dependencies

- Using terminal (command line or PowerShell) run the script:

  ```shell
  python attack.py
  ```

### Linux and MacOS

- Install [Python 3.8](https://python.org) (or later version)
  > ‚ö† Linux users, your system may have Python version 2 pre-installed, which means that you need to run this program with the `python3` command and set the installation requirements with the `pip3` command.

- Clone repository:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Luzhnuy/attacker.git
  ```

- Install all the required dependencies:
  ```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Run the script:
  ```shell
  python attack.py
  ```

### Docker

- Install [Docker](https://docker.com):
  - Docker for Windows: https://ravesli.com/ustanovka-docker-v-windows/
  - Docker for MacOS: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/
  - Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

- Download docker image:

  ```shell
  docker pull ghcr.io/luzhnuy/attacker:latest
  ```

- Launch the container for the 500 threads:

  ```shell
  docker run --rm ghcr.io/luzhnuy/attacker:latest 500
  ```

#### Docker environment variables list

- `ATTACKER_THREADS`: _(integer)_ Defines the number of threads used in the script.
- `ATTACKER_TARGET`: _(JSON array with URLs)_ Defines target sites that will be used as a targets instead of a dynamic list of sites retrieved by API.

### Docker Compose

`docker-compose` allows you to easily run containers in parallel without having to keep multiple terminals opened. To run on servers - perfect choice.

- Clone repository:
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Luzhnuy/attacker.git
  ```

- Build and run `5` containers **in parallel** (each handles `500` connections):

  ```shell
  docker-compose up --build --scale attacker=5
  ```

- Stop containers from `docker-compose.yml` file: `Ctrl + C`

### For people who are not very familiar with computer science, Windows users

1. Download the archive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aQR53fcbvkGY-bY0V4YhzLY6obh8H6Ln/view?usp=sharing

2. Extract archive
   > ‚ö† **IMPORTANT**! DO NOT extract files to desktop folder and not to a folder contains cyrillic symbols. Preferred place to extract is the root of the drive `D:`

3. Find the `install.bat` file (you may see it as just `install`).
   
   Click on it using right-click, select `Start as Administrator`.

4. Follow step by step everything you see in the black window (press the number of the corresponding item, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, allow programs to be installed, at the end select the next item.
   <i> For example "Install python (step1)" - You need to enter the number `1` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd></i>

5. When the process of installing everything you need is complete, a wizard will open in which you can run the `Attack.bat` file (maybe just Attack).

In the future, you no longer need to run install, just start `attack.bat` to get started. You also don't need to check for updates, this process happens automatically.

> ‚ö† If you have already installed `bash` on your Windows machine - do not use` bash`, use `PowerShell` or` cmd`
